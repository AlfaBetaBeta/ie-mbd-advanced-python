The advantage is that Linux is the Operative System used in 96 % of the world's servers, 100 % of TOP500 supercomputers, and 90 % of all Cloud infrastructure[[1](https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-the-internet-exist-without-linux/)][[2](https://itsfoss.com/linux-runs-top-supercomputers/)][[3](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/blog/certifications/open-source/why-linux-runs-90-percent-of-the-public-cloud-workload)], therefore learning it is very good use of one's time."
