    "1. ~~Using the OS-provided Python~, the most common one, is **the wrong thing to do**. It requires admin privileges, and manipulating it might leave the system in a broken state. In Windows this is not a problem because Python is not pre-installed, but it is on Linux and macOS.\n",
    "2. **Downloading it from Python.org** works in all operative systems, does not require admin permissions, allows you to choose the version you want, and ships a tool to create development environments (`venv`). However, `venv` cannot create environments with different Python versions (you're tied to the one you downloaded) and certain packages will not be readily available on Windows. Therefore, it is _not for everyone_.\n",
    "3. **Using Anaconda** has all the advantages of Python.org, and additionally makes it trivial to install common Scientific/Data libraries on Windows using `conda`. However, mixing `conda` with the official Python package installer, `pip`, might produce unexpected results, and requires careful handling. This will be our choice.\n",
    "4. Using Docker containers provides perfect isolation at the cost of complexity, and in fact some people argue that Docker should be left for _deployment_ rather than _development_. We will not explore this option."

Packages are installed with `pip`. Useful to know because it's the most common option, but does not work with `conda`, so we won't use it in this course.\n",
    "2. **Docker** is a highly popular tool for complex application development and deployment. Not so good for development.\n",
